# DNA-Sequecne-Software-Project
Built a software that accepts DNA sequence and returns the amino acid sequence of proteins that it encodes
Integrated various processes like transcribing DNA, reading encodings, translating DNA and finally creating RNA sequence
Tested the code for E.Coli. genome and listed possible mRNA sequences presented in the FASTA format
Generated sequences for the different offsets like number of proteins, average protein size and frequency of each protein
